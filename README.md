# Short-Video-Classification
## 1. Extract frames from short video
In my opinion, the classification problem of short videos is essentially a problem of classifying a group of images, 
so I first learned some ways to extract images from short videos. At the same time, I extracted 5 images from each short video.
## 2. Extract features from images
After the image has been generated, the processing of the problem becomes substantially the same as the first question.
I try to use Residual Network(ResNet50) that change the last fc layer to extract features on image. ResNet50 is a 50-layer Residual Network.
## 3. Merge labels
The provided label is merged with the generated features by indexing the DataFrame. 
In other words, the five images generated by the same short video have the same label.
## 4. Classifier model
For the classification problem of supervised learning, I used the xgboost method to classifier.
## 5. Generate labels for video files
From the previous process, I generated 5 labels for each video file (5 frames respectively), 
and the last thing I need to do is to use the most popular category to represent the label of this video.
If there is more than one maximum value, a random label is taken from it.
